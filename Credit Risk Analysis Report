# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

* Purpose: The purpose of this analysis is to determine the credit risk of each loan and classify them accordingly

* Background: Data provided was both loan and borrower sepecific, including `loan size`, `borrower income`, `interest rates`, and `debt to income ratio`

* Processes used:
  * The original data sample provided was split into two types: `training data` and `testing data`
    * Training data: Used to train the model based on labels/targets already provkded in the data
    * Testing data: acquired from the original data to be used after the model is built to test the accuracy and pricision of the           model built
  * Using the `Training Data` a `Logistic Regression` model was built and trained using the `SciKit-learn` library
 
## Results

* The classification report identifies that:
    * `100%` pecision and `99%` recall for class_1
    * `84%` precision and `94%` recall for class_2
    * The model demonstrates an excellent overall accuracy of `99%`, though the performance on class_2 is noteablly weaker. this            could be beacuse of difference in size (only 619 examples compared to 18,765 examples for class_1)
